# CENG463-HW

**Repository for IZTECH CENG463: Introduction to Machine Learning Homework Assignments**

This repository contains homework assignments for the CENG463 Introduction to Machine Learning course. Each contributor is responsible for creating and maintaining their branch for code development, following specific guidelines for collaboration and merging.

## Contribution Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines to keep the repository organized and the workflow smooth for all team members.

### 1. Branching
- **Create a New Branch**: When starting work on a homework, create a new branch based on the main branch.
  - **Branch Naming Convention**: Use the following format:  
    `hw<homework number>-<your name>`  
    _Example_: `hw1-Ali` for Ali's first homework.
- **Push to Your Branch**: All commits should be pushed to your own branch. Avoid pushing directly to the main branch.

### 2. Workflow
1. **Pull the Latest Changes**: Before starting any new work, ensure you have the latest version of the main branch:
   
   git pull origin main

   git checkout -b hw<homework number>-<your name>

   git add .

   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

   git push origin hw<homework number>-<your name>

### 3. Merging with Main

  Team Agreement: Only merge your branch with main after all contributors agree that the   code is complete and ready.
  Pull Requests: Open a pull request for your branch and request reviews from team     
  members. After receiving approvals, merge the branch with main.


### Notes

  **Keep main branch stable:** Avoid committing directly to main to maintain a stable 
    main branch for everyone.
  
  **Pull frequently:** Regularly pull changes from the main branch to minimize conflicts.
  
  **Write clear commit messages:** Use meaningful commit messages to document what each      change does.
